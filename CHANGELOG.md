# Changelog

All notable changes to the `agentveil` SDK.

## [Unreleased]

### Documentation
- Clarified the public version source of truth across README, changelog, and
  roadmap surfaces.

## [0.7.44-mcp-proxy] - 2026-08-10

Current public MCP Proxy package marker.

### MCP Proxy package
- Current package metadata and PyPI release: `agentveil-mcp-proxy 0.7.44`.
- The proxy package depends on `agentveil>=0.7.23,<0.8`, matching the current
  public SDK package line.
- This entry restores visible changelog continuity after public notes previously
  stopped at `0.7.35-mcp-proxy`. Detailed per-version notes for the 0.7.36
  through 0.7.44 patch series were not maintained in this file before this
  catch-up entry.

## [0.7.35-mcp-proxy] - 2026-07-23

Verified redirect lineage and Approval Center action-review release.

### MCP Proxy changed
- Added durable lineage with an atomic single-use claim between a
  connector-native write stopped
  before mutation and the matching controlled MCP `write_file` follow-up.
- Added a bounded Redirect context section to Approval Center cards only when
  the original native denial, client/session/project scope, target, intent,
  freshness, and atomic claim are verified.
- Added a responsive action-review layout with bounded action summaries,
  requested-change previews, approval countdown, and terminal expired state.
- Kept ordinary direct MCP approvals unchanged when no verified redirect
  context is present.
- Corrected Windows owner-claim locking so a separate hook process can verify
  the live proxy binding while the exclusive liveness lease remains held.

### MCP Proxy verification
- The combined local public SDK gate completed with 2044 passing tests; two
  wheel-install checks unable to build under local sandbox permissions were
  rerun outside the sandbox and both passed.
- GitHub Actions passed on Ubuntu Python 3.10-3.13, Windows, macOS, managed
  Approval Center E2E jobs, and the bounded Windows symlink job before release
  preparation.

## [0.7.34-mcp-proxy] - 2026-07-22

Public Runtime Gate interoperability and package trust-boundary corrective.

### MCP Proxy changed
- Aligned outbound Runtime Gate environment values with the canonical public
  contract while retaining bounded compatibility for legacy headless policies.
- Required an externally configured signer identity when verifying
  EdDSA-JCS-2022 receipts and approval grants. Verification boundary: a
  document cannot establish its own trust authority.
- Rejected CLI-like, path-like, URL-like, malformed, and explicit null package
  names before any product-route pip subprocess call.

### MCP Proxy verification
- The canonical local public SDK gate passed with 1950 tests and 51 platform
  skips.
- GitHub Actions passed on Ubuntu Python 3.10-3.13, Windows, macOS, managed
  Approval Center E2E, and the bounded Windows symlink job before release prep.

## [0.7.33-mcp-proxy] - 2026-07-21

Public MCP Proxy availability, replay protection, filesystem containment, and
concurrency corrective.

### MCP Proxy changed
- Added bounded unavailable-route handling and one-at-a-time downstream
  reconnect without repeated approvals, native-tool bypass guidance, or
  automatic mutation replay.
- Retired approvals owned by dead proxy instances or obsolete downstream
  generations so stale cards cannot execute after reconnect or PID reuse.
- Bound filesystem mutations to verified directory handles on POSIX and
  Windows to contain symlink swaps between validation and execution.
- Allowed two independent mutation approvals to remain pending concurrently
  while keeping downstream mutation execution serialized and request-local.
- Added bounded concurrent processing for read-only tools, including overload
  backpressure, exact response-ID attribution, and deterministic shutdown.

### MCP Proxy verification
- Natural live outage/reconnect, stale-card recovery, and concurrent
  Approve/Deny acceptance passed without connector-specific product changes.
- An independent cumulative audit covered the three fixes released in 0.7.32
  together with the six fixes in this release and found no P0/P1 blocker.
- The combined local public SDK gate passed with 1903 tests and 51 platform
  skips; GitHub Actions passed on Ubuntu, Windows, macOS, managed Approval
  Center E2E, and the bounded native Windows TOCTOU job.

## [0.7.32-mcp-proxy] - 2026-07-18

Public MCP Proxy path-boundary and Approval Center recovery corrective.

### MCP Proxy changed
- Canonicalized in-workspace paths containing internal parent components
  while preserving denial of real escapes, symlink escapes, and control paths.
- Hid `.git/**` and `.avp/**`, including resolved aliases, from
  `list_workspace` without hiding useful similarly named user files.
- Added per-request Approval Center delivery state and a bounded
  recovery command for pending cards when automatic browser delivery fails.
- Added recovery CLI validation and schema migration for existing
  delivery evidence records.

### MCP Proxy verification
- Natural live Approve and Deny acceptance passed without reload or manual URL
  lookup.
- The combined local public SDK gate passed with 1769 tests and one skip.
- GitHub Actions passed across Ubuntu 3.10–3.13, Windows, macOS, and managed
  Approval Center E2E before merge.

## [0.7.30-mcp-proxy] / [0.7.21-sdk] - 2026-07-16

Paired public SDK and MCP Proxy release candidate. The paired versions keep
the proxy's runtime install-clone integration aligned with the SDK module it
imports.

### Public SDK added
- Added bounded runtime install-clone context validation and agent integration.

### Public SDK changed
- Kept invalid install-clone metadata keys out of emitted evidence.

### MCP Proxy added
- Added role-aware doctor and status visibility for managed agent runtime
  projects.
- Added public paid-activation, install, and provider-configuration command
  surfaces.
- Added bounded install-clone advisory and metadata evidence collection.

### MCP Proxy changed
- Reframed legacy entry-point documentation around routed action control.
- Denied generic quickstart filesystem enumeration and reads of local
  `.avp/mcp-proxy/**` control artifacts, including resolved directory and file
  symlink aliases, while preserving ordinary workspace reads and the existing
  Approval Center and redirect paths.
- Raised the public SDK dependency floor to `agentveil>=0.7.21,<0.8` so the
  proxy cannot install against an SDK that lacks `runtime_install_clone`.

### Boundary
- The control-artifact containment applies to filesystem operations routed
  through the MCP Proxy; it is not host-wide filesystem interception.

## [0.7.29-mcp-proxy] - 2026-07-06

Public trust and approval environment hardening release for
`agentveil-mcp-proxy`.

### MCP Proxy added
- Added `agentveil-mcp-proxy demo`, a local guided flow that shows the generic
  routed MCP redirect shape, browser approval, retry, and bounded local proof
  without exposing policy catalogs or private playbook depth.

### MCP Proxy changed
- Updated the public README PyPI badge and package version signal to `0.7.29`.
- Improved root CLI help around the first-run path and kept `init` next-step
  guidance privacy-bounded when custom home/config paths are used.
- Qualified evidence verification output so empty bundles and chain-only
  bundles no longer render as bare `VERIFY: passed`.
- Started managed Approval Center child processes with a bounded environment
  instead of inheriting the full parent shell environment across shared,
  launcher, and legacy Claude lifecycle paths.

### MCP Proxy verification
- Local public SDK PR gate passed on PR #104 head with `1566 passed, 1 skipped`.
- GitHub Actions passed for PR #104 across macOS, Windows, and Ubuntu
  compatibility checks before merge.

## [0.7.28-mcp-proxy] - 2026-07-02

Launcher lifecycle and status hardening release for `agentveil-mcp-proxy`.

### MCP Proxy added
- Added `launch doctor` as a read-only preflight for managed agent runtime
  projects, showing route, Approval Center, approval wait-mode, provider, and
  local proof readiness without spawning a child process.

### MCP Proxy changed
- Improved managed launcher status output so local proof hints appear only
  when proof records exist, and empty projects get setup-oriented next steps.
- Moved managed Approval Center start/status/stop paths onto shared lifecycle
  helpers used by launcher and setup flows.
- Reused healthy managed Approval Centers, replaced stale owned centers before
  spawning new ones, and stopped managed centers by exact owned PID instead of
  broad process-name matching.

### MCP Proxy verification
- Local public SDK PR gate passed before merge with `1527 passed, 1 skipped`.
- GitHub Actions passed for PR #94 across macOS, Windows, and Ubuntu
  compatibility checks before merge.
- Post-merge Gemini CLI sanity confirmed trusted folder setup, routed MCP
  `write_file`, local approval, target reach, and intact `local_proof` on the
  merged `main` build.

## [0.7.27-mcp-proxy] - 2026-07-01

Autonomous agent launcher and Hermes controlled MCP profile release for
`agentveil-mcp-proxy`.

### MCP Proxy added
- Added managed runtime launcher support for local agent processes, including a
  `generic-process` profile with project-local runtime state, managed Approval
  Center startup, bounded status, and local proof-ready routing.
- Added `launch --choose-folder` for launcher setup parity with project
  connectors.
- Added the `hermes-cli` controlled MCP profile. Hermes launches with a
  project-local Hermes home, AgentVeil MCP route, foreground output, bounded
  provider environment passthrough, approval, sandbox boundaries, redirect
  guidance inside the AgentVeil route, and local proof.

### MCP Proxy changed
- Updated README and package README with a Hermes CLI quickstart and explicit
  claim boundary: controlled MCP route foundation, not host-wide native
  containment.
- Improved already-decided Approval Center pages so stale approval URLs show
  human-first approved/denied/expired messages with technical details collapsed.

### MCP Proxy verification
- GitHub Actions passed for PR #93 across the supported compatibility matrix.
- Local public SDK PR gate ran; two wheel-build tests failed only under the
  Codex sandbox because `pip wheel` could not update `agentveil.egg-info`, and
  targeted rerun of those two tests outside the sandbox passed.
- Live Hermes CLI testing confirmed routed read/write behavior, approval
  continuation, sandbox hard-blocking, redirect follow-up inside the AgentVeil
  MCP route, shell-pressure routing through `mcp_agentveil_write_file`, and
  intact local proof.

## [0.7.26-mcp-proxy] - 2026-07-01

Public connector and approval-loop release for `agentveil-mcp-proxy`.

### MCP Proxy added
- Added Gemini CLI connector foundation with project-local setup, MCP route,
  managed Approval Center startup, and documented one-time folder trust
  boundary.
- Added Codex connector foundation for interactive Codex TUI with project-local
  setup, hook trust status, MCP route, and explicit `codex exec` non-claim.
- Added `local_proof` as a read-only MCP tool so agents can inspect bounded
  local proof without asking for shell access.

### MCP Proxy changed
- Enabled interactive setup paths to wait for browser approval before returning
  from the MCP call, so approved actions can continue in the same agent turn
  when the client keeps the tool call open.
- Improved local proof output so the default agent-facing proof is a concise
  human summary, while JSON/debug evidence remains available on request.
- Updated README and package README connector quickstarts for Cursor, Claude
  Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI.

### MCP Proxy verification
- GitHub Actions passed for the merged connector and release-doc PRs across the
  supported compatibility matrix.
- Live Gemini CLI testing confirmed folder trust, MCP approval, approved write
  continuation, and `local_proof` inspection on the tested local setup.

## [0.7.25-mcp-proxy] - 2026-06-29

Public beta hardening release for the `agentveil-mcp-proxy` proof and retry
loop.

### MCP Proxy added
- Added `events show` as the bounded human-readable local evidence view, with
  JSON and local hash-chain verification options for scripting and CI use.
- Added explicit approval retry contract fields for approval-required MCP
  calls, including same-tool, same-target, and same-payload retry requirements.

### MCP Proxy changed
- Clarified the public README and package README around the AgentVeil loop:
  attempt, decision, controlled path when available, and local proof.
- Improved approval and post-approval copy so users and agents are told to
  retry the same MCP tool call without changing tool, target, or payload.
- Refined decision messages for classifier and runtime sanity failures so they
  no longer look like ordinary policy stops.

### MCP Proxy verification
- GitHub Actions passed for the merged hardening PR across the supported
  compatibility matrix.
- Local installed-path smoke passed after merge, covering read-only tools,
  write approval, Approval Center UX, and `events show`.

## [0.7.24-mcp-proxy] - 2026-06-26

Public beta approval UX hardening release for `agentveil-mcp-proxy`.

### MCP Proxy fixed
- Allowed read-only filesystem MCP tools such as `list_workspace`, `read_file`,
  `get_file_info`, and `instruction_surface_status` without unnecessary
  approval in the filesystem policy path.
- Improved the local Approval Center first screen so the main view shows a
  human-readable action summary, target, risk, and approve/deny controls, with
  raw bounded evidence kept under technical details.
- Added structured MCP error fields for approval-required and hard-denied
  paths, including `reason_code`, `approval_possible`,
  `retry_after_approval`, `next_step`, `suggested_tool`, and bounded sandbox
  hints where applicable.
- Clarified README positioning for AgentVeil as an independent action-control
  layer around configured project connectors and routed MCP calls.

### MCP Proxy verification
- GitHub Actions passed for the merged public beta hardening PR across the
  supported compatibility matrix.
- Local non-live MCP Proxy suite passed with `1367 passed, 1 skipped` before
  preparing this release bump.

## [0.7.20] - 2026-06-01

Verifier-readiness release for `execution_receipt/3` and
`human_approval_receipt/3`. `agentveil.proof.verify_proof_packet` now accepts
the full `/3` receipt family (decision, execution, human approval) routed
through the first-party data-integrity (`eddsa-jcs-2022`) hashData verifier.
<!-- claim-check: allow release note names the implemented local verifier path, not third-party certification -->
This is not a third-party conformance certification.

### Added
- Added `execution_receipt/3` and `human_approval_receipt/3` to the
  data-integrity verifier routing set alongside `decision_receipt/3`.
- Added `_STRICT_EXECUTION_SCHEMAS` and `_STRICT_APPROVAL_SCHEMAS` so `/3`
  inherits `/2` strictness for shared intent fields and `decision_receipt_hash`
  mandatory-field checks.
- Added focused tests covering happy path, tamper rejection, role separation,
  missing/mismatched `decision_receipt_hash`, missing/mismatched shared intent
  fields, `proofPurpose` stripped/changed, and proof `@context` mismatch for
  both new receipt families.

### Unchanged
- Legacy `/1` and `/2` receipt verification stays on the raw-JCS path
  (`verify_signed_jcs`).
- `decision_receipt/3` verification behavior is unchanged from 0.7.19.

### MCP Proxy package

The separately packaged `agentveil-mcp-proxy` package is also released as
`0.7.20` on PyPI. This proxy release focuses on safer pre-approval handling,
local evidence records for denied tool calls, and policy-pack coverage for
common MCP server families.

### MCP Proxy fixed
- Fixed the non-blocking approval retry path so an approved tool call can be
  retried immediately without creating a second pending approval.
- Fixed unknown or non-advertised MCP tools so the negative-test path returns a
  pre-approval policy denial.
- Fixed invalid tool arguments so schema-denied calls are rejected before
  approval.
- Added terminal, privacy-preserving evidence records for unknown-tool,
  schema-deny, and filesystem path hard-deny paths.
- Fixed filesystem path handling so absolute paths and traversal paths are
  hard-denied before approval, while lexically normalized inside paths such as
  `subdir/../notes.md` are no longer falsely denied.
- Added Git MCP tool classification and a `git` policy pack, including CLI
  `--policy-pack git` selection.
- Added a `fetch` policy pack and CLI `--policy-pack fetch` selection. Fetch
  calls to cloud metadata/link-local targets such as `169.254.169.254` are
  classified for local policy blocking.

### MCP Proxy verification
- Verified a clean PyPI install of `agentveil-mcp-proxy==0.7.20` with
  `agentveil==0.7.20`.
- Verified a persistent product-path smoke using the PyPI package: filesystem
  `tools/list`, valid relative `write_file` approval and immediate retry,
  unknown-tool deny, schema-deny, absolute path deny, traversal deny, and
  normalized-inside approval each exercised the live proxy process.
- Verified final local evidence counts from the smoke evidence summary:
  deny records `4`, approved records `2`, executed records `2`, and pending
  records `0`.
- Verified strict evidence bundle verification with the proxy agent DID as the
  trusted signer DID. The smoke bundle did not contain signed runtime receipts
  (`signed_receipt_count=0`).
- Verified direct product gates for the Git and Fetch policy packs. The live
  console smoke used a filesystem downstream only, so Git and Fetch were not
  re-verified through that console path.

### MCP Proxy follow-ups
- If a future smoke bundle contains signed runtime receipts, strict verification
  should also include the backend signer DIDs or configured trust anchors.
- Fetch metadata-IP blocking was verified through the direct policy gate. If
  operators require terminal evidence parity for metadata local-policy blocks,
  that should be handled as a separate follow-up.

## [0.7.19] - 2026-05-31

PyPI package alignment release for the MCP Proxy split.

The public `agentveil` package is released as `0.7.19` because `agentveil==0.7.18`
already exists on PyPI and cannot be overwritten. This release publishes the
SDK code required by the separately packaged MCP Proxy, including the
`agentveil.data_integrity` verifier module used by proxy receipt verification.

The first public `agentveil-mcp-proxy` package is also versioned `0.7.19` and
depends on `agentveil>=0.7.19,<0.8`. New proxy installs remain one command:
`pip install agentveil-mcp-proxy`.

## [0.7.18] - 2026-05-28

MCP Proxy and proof verification hardening release. This release closes the
0.7.17 approval-required stdio gap, moves the MCP Proxy into a separate
source-available package, and tightens proof/evidence verification defaults.

The root `agentveil` package still contains the public SDK, hosted MCP server,
and Paperclip helper. The MCP Proxy is now packaged separately as
`agentveil-mcp-proxy` under the Business Source License 1.1.

### Added
- Added `decision_receipt/3` signing and verification helpers. The SDK verifies
  `/3` through its first-party Data Integrity verifier; this is not a
  third-party conformance certification.
- Added `decision_receipt/3` support to `verify_proof_packet` while preserving
  legacy `/1` and `/2` raw-JCS receipt verification paths.
- Added `--json` support to `agentveil-mcp-proxy register`.
- Added an MCP Proxy release acceptance runner that builds or consumes a wheel,
  installs it into a clean virtualenv, drives the quickstart filesystem MCP
  server through the proxy, approves a risky action through the loopback UI,
  retries the action, and verifies events/evidence export.
- Added a declared tool-surface configuration for MCP Proxy
  (`tool_surface.mode = off | observe | enforce`) with an operator-managed
  allowlist.
- Added a separate `agentveil-mcp-proxy` package under
  `packages/agentveil-mcp-proxy/`. The `agentveil-mcp-proxy` console command is
  preserved.

### Changed
- `verify_evidence_bundle` / `verify_evidence_bundle_file` now default to
  strict verification (`strict=True`). Proof-grade verification requires
  externally pinned signer DIDs.
- In proof-grade mode a receipt-bearing bundle requires externally pinned
  `trusted_signer_dids`; the bundle's embedded signer list is not an accepted
  trust anchor, and a referenced-but-missing signed receipt fails closed.
- `decision_receipt/1` and `/2` remain explicit legacy raw-JCS verification
  paths. The historical self-asserted in-bundle-trust behavior is available
  only via `strict=False` / `verify_evidence_bundle_legacy(...)` and is not
  proof-grade.
- Corrected Microsoft AGT / AgentMesh docs wording so `AVPProvider` remains
  named while AgentVeil is described as an external trust and reputation
  integration.
- Changed MCP Proxy approval-required stdio calls to return an immediate
  structured `approval_required` response with the local evidence record ID and
  approval URL instead of holding the MCP request open until timeout.
- Approved exact local approval records now authorize one identical retry, so
  clients can complete the approved MCP tool call after the user approves it in
  the local browser approval UI.
- Changed the default Runtime Gate unavailable fallback for read-class tool
  calls from `allow` to `approval`. Operators may still explicitly configure
  `read = "allow"` as an opt-in risk decision.
- Changed `similar_5m` approval reuse so it requires an extracted
  `resource_hash`. Calls without a resource binding require a fresh approval.
- Changed the MCP Proxy packaging split: root `agentveil` wheels no longer ship
  the proxy package or the `agentveil-mcp-proxy` console entry point. Install
  the proxy with `pip install agentveil-mcp-proxy`; it installs the core
  `agentveil` SDK as a dependency.
- Documented the MCP Proxy release acceptance procedure as a release gate for
  serious MCP Proxy setup, passthrough, approval, evidence, and Runtime Gate
  changes.

### Fixed
- Fixed MCP Proxy argument validation so tool-call arguments are checked before
  approval when the downstream tool schema is available.
- Fixed classifier exception handling so a classifier failure on `tools/call`
  fails closed instead of forwarding without policy or Runtime Gate evaluation.
- Fixed unsafe filesystem tool paths so path traversal and secret-like file
  reads are rejected before approval and downstream forwarding.
- Fixed the Runtime Gate unavailable fallback path so the default read-class
  behavior is approval-required rather than silent allow.
- Fixed the `ASK_BACKEND` library-embed path without a Runtime Gate factory so
  it fails closed with `runtime_gate_not_configured` instead of forwarding.

### Notes
- The GitHub release workflow still publishes the root `agentveil` package
  only. Publishing the separate `agentveil-mcp-proxy` package requires a
  separate release/publishing decision.
- The `agentveil-mcp-proxy` source is visible under
  `packages/agentveil-mcp-proxy/` and is licensed separately from the root SDK.

## [0.7.17] - 2026-05-28

MCP Proxy first-run repair release. The published `0.7.16` wheel did not
include the newer `register` and `doctor --check-backend` CLI path that the
GitHub docs described; this patch version is the releasable package state for
that customer path plus local downstream/operator visibility helpers.

### Added
- Added `agentveil-mcp-proxy configure-downstream` to write downstream MCP
  server config without manual JSON edits, plus the preferred
  `agentveil-mcp-proxy downstream set` command spelling.
- Added `agentveil-mcp-proxy init --quickstart-filesystem <path>` with a
  built-in sandboxed filesystem downstream for zero-dependency local smoke
  testing.
- Added `agentveil-mcp-proxy doctor --full` and `agentveil-mcp-proxy smoke` to
  launch the configured downstream and verify MCP `initialize` / `tools/list`.
- Added privacy-safe `events list`, `events tail`, and `evidence-summary`
  operator views.
- Added JSON output for non-interactive setup and checks (`init`, downstream
  setup, `doctor`, `smoke`, and event views).

### Changed
- Updated MCP Proxy quickstart docs with Ubuntu packaging prerequisites,
  virtualenv install commands, downstream helper usage, full doctor/smoke
  checks, JSON output, and the new event views.

## [0.7.16] - 2026-05-26

Paperclip MCP integration helper release. Adds read-only local helper commands
for operators who route Paperclip-managed Claude/Codex tool calls through the
AgentVeil MCP proxy.

### Added
- Added `agentveil paperclip doctor` and `agentveil-paperclip doctor` for
  read-only local readiness checks covering the AgentVeil MCP proxy and local
  Claude/Codex runtime configuration presence.
- Added `agentveil paperclip init --dry-run` and
  `agentveil-paperclip init --dry-run` for a non-mutating setup preview. Plain
  `init` remains refused in this release.
- Added privacy-by-default redaction of local filesystem paths in Paperclip
  helper output, with `--show-paths` as an explicit local diagnostic opt-in.

### Changed
- Added a Paperclip integration guide documenting the MCP-routed action
  boundary, the read-only helpers, and current sandbox/remote limitations.

## [0.7.15] - 2026-05-12

Post-launch polish release: discoverability fixes for the v0.1 MCP Proxy
adapter and Tier 1 differentiator framing per the AgentVeil design principles
roadmap. Zero production code changes; documentation, metadata, and design
narrative only.

### Changed
- Bumped PyPI `Development Status` classifier from `4 - Beta` to
  `5 - Production/Stable` to match the project's commercial-bar discipline.
- Surfaced the `agentveil-mcp-proxy` MCP transport proxy adapter in the
  top-level `README.md` integrations table alongside framework adapters,
  Bedrock, and Microsoft AgentMesh.
- Surfaced the MCP transport proxy in `README_PYPI.md` features list and
  added a dedicated section with quick-start commands and a link to the
  subproject README.
- Added `mcp-proxy` keyword to `pyproject.toml` for PyPI search discovery.
- Reframed customer-facing authorization narrative as capability tokens
  (signed, scoped, time-bounded, replay-resistant, attenuatable) per Mark
  Miller (2006) and Macaroons (NDSS 2014) discipline. AVP's existing
  `similar_5m` scope expansion already implements these properties; this
  release names them explicitly.
- Adjusted customer copy to acknowledge HRU 1976 undecidability of the general
  access-control safety problem. AVP claims constrained, auditable, reversible
  decisions within the practically decidable policy subset, not unconditional
  safety.
- Updated public repository URL references in `README.md`, `README_PYPI.md`,
  `pyproject.toml`, `AGENTS.md`, and `agentveil_mcp/server.py`, and refreshed
  customer-facing example paths in `agentveil_mcp/README.md`,
  `examples/proof_pack/README.md`, and `mcp_server/README.md` from `avp-sdk`
  to `agentveil-sdk` after the GitHub repository rename for brand consistency
  with the `agentveil` PyPI package name. Operator-local
  `/Users/.../avp-sdk-public` release-smoke paths remain unchanged.
- Added an MCP transport proxy "what's new" callout to the top-level
  `README.md` hero section surfacing the v0.7.15 ship and IDE client coverage
  without disrupting the AVP product-led hero tagline.

### Added
- New design principles document at
  [`docs/MCP_PROXY_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`](docs/MCP_PROXY_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md)
  mapping AgentVeil MCP Proxy architecture to the eight Saltzer-Schroeder
  (1975) principles: economy of mechanism, fail-safe defaults, complete
  mediation, open design, separation of privilege, least privilege, least
  common mechanism, and psychological acceptability.

### Audit References
- Discoverability fixes: PL-1, PL-2, PL-3, PL-4, caught reviewer-side after
  the P11.5 ceremony.
- Differentiator items: #1 Saltzer-Schroeder citation, #2 HRU honest framing,
  #3 capability discipline reframing - Tier 1 free items from
  `avp_mcp_proxy_differentiators_roadmap.md`.

### Validation
- No production code changes. Pytest baseline unchanged: 642 passed, 1 skipped.
- Bandit static analysis unchanged: 6 LOW, 0 MEDIUM, 0 HIGH.
- All refined customer-facing wording scans (AI-attribution, prohibited
  product terminology, production-grade strict reading) return zero matches
  post-edit.

## [0.7.14] - 2026-05-11

AgentVeil MCP Proxy v0.1 first public release. Action Control Plane for IDE
MCP clients wrapping downstream MCP servers with runtime decision gating,
human approval routing, durable signed evidence, and replay defense.

### Added
- Added the `agentveil-mcp-proxy` console script and
  `python -m agentveil_mcp_proxy` entry point for MCP transport proxy
  operation.
- Added encrypted local proxy identity storage with Argon2id and SecretBox,
  passphrase-file support, `AVP_PROXY_PASSPHRASE`, a 12-character minimum for
  new identities, and documented passphrase-source trade-offs.
- Added Runtime Gate integration with DecisionReceipt verification, schema
  enforcement, audit ID binding, payload hash binding, risk class binding,
  policy context hash binding, and circuit breaker handling.
- Added a local TTL-capped DecisionReceipt replay cache as a v0.1 compensating
  control before the backend nonce/freshness protocol update.
- Added the loopback browser approval server with CSRF checks, HMAC cookies,
  per-prompt tokens, Content-Length bounds, socket timeouts, and
  `ThreadingHTTPServer`.
- Added a durable SQLite evidence store with WAL mode, hash chaining, fsync
  durability, owner-only permissions, and auxiliary WAL/SHM permission
  hardening after commits.
- Added offline evidence bundle export and verification covering chain
  integrity, signed receipt validation, receipt binding checks, audit ID
  matching, and receipt-reference dedupe.
- Added headless approval mode and bounded headless policy support with
  owner-only policy-file validation.
- Added built-in policy packs for `default`, `github`, `filesystem`, and
  `shell`, including broadened destructive coverage for `purge_*`,
  `truncate_*`, `wipe_*`, `format_*`, `rm`, `rmdir_*`, `unlink_*`, and
  `clean_*` patterns where applicable.
- Expanded destructive classification prefixes with `purge`, `truncate`,
  `wipe`, `format`, `rm`, `rmdir`, `unlink`, and `clean`.
- Added cross-platform CI coverage across 3 operating systems and 4 Python
  versions, workflow dispatch support, pinned GitHub Actions SHAs, and
  `permissions: contents: read`.
- Added `env_passthrough` blocking for the reserved `AVP_*` prefix so proxy
  secrets cannot be forwarded to downstream MCP servers by configuration.
- Added the MCP Proxy subproject README and the operations guide at
  `docs/MCP_PROXY_OPERATIONS.md`.

### Security
- Completed the P10.5 security audit remediation train: 12 MEDIUM and 8 LOW
  findings were identified across independent passes; 10 MEDIUM findings were
  closed in P10.6-P10.10, M-2 received the local replay-cache mitigation, and
  M-10 was deferred to v0.1.1.
- Completed the post-P10.9 mid-train audit: 2 MEDIUM and 3 LOW findings were
  identified; MT-1, MT-2, and MT-3 were closed in P10.10, while MT-4 and MT-5
  were accepted as v0.1 LOW risk.
- Annotated the 14-site Bandit B608 SQL false-positive cluster with narrow
  `# nosec B608` rationale comments.
- Verified public documentation surfaces for attribution wording and prohibited
  product terminology.
- Added receipt `audit_id` cross-checking and duplicate receipt-reference
  rejection to the offline verifier.
- Added positive-value validation for RuntimeGateClient replay-cache settings.
- Hardened CLI identity, config, and grant writes with file fsync and parent
  directory fsync.
- Added a 1 MiB client-to-proxy JSON-RPC line cap matching the downstream
  message cap.
- Bounded downstream response bookkeeping with in-flight ID tracking,
  TTL-pruned timed-out IDs, unsolicited-response counting, and retained
  response caps.
- Required DecisionReceipt schema, audit ID, and receipt binding fields in
  offline evidence verification.

### Known Limitations
- **Backend protocol nonce/freshness:** the local replay cache mitigates
  same-process replays within a five-minute window. The v0.1.1 protocol update
  adds backend-issued nonce plus `issued_at` and `expires_at` fields to a new
  `decision_receipt/3` schema. Same-intent replays across proxy restarts and
  against a compromised backend response channel remain possible in v0.1.
- **Windows Job Object race:** Windows downstream process containment has a
  narrow `start()` window where a child process can spawn descendants before
  assignment to the Job Object. Use an external Windows service supervisor for
  production Windows deployments until the v0.1.1 fix lands.
- **OS keychain identity storage:** v0.1 uses passphrase-encrypted Argon2id
  identity files. v0.1.1+ adds opt-in macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service, and
  Windows Credential Manager integration.
- **P7a WAL/SHM creation-window race:** the evidence store chmods auxiliary
  SQLite files after every commit; a small in-flight transaction window still
  depends on the user umask. Accepted as v0.1 LOW risk.
- **P7b runtime-only chain validation:** chain integrity is validated at store
  open and after write transactions; there is no periodic background chain
  validation during a long-running proxy. Periodic restarts are the v0.1
  mitigation.
- **MT-4 receipt cache eviction under sustained burst:** sustained high-volume
  legitimate receipts can evict captured receipts before the nominal TTL,
  weakening local replay defense in adversarial timing scenarios. The v0.1.1
  protocol nonce/freshness fix supersedes this mitigation.
- **MT-5 `granted_by_request_id` reference validation:** the verifier does not
  dereference cache-hit `granted_by_request_id` values to prove the referenced
  record exists in the same bundle. Manual auditors should cross-check those
  references when reviewing cache-hit evidence.

### Audit References

### Validation
- P11 release gate passed: main CI matrix green on 12/12 cells, full local
  pytest passed with `642 passed, 1 skipped`, Bandit reported 0 HIGH and
  0 MEDIUM findings, pip-audit reported 0 known vulnerabilities, public-surface
  wording scans passed, console scripts worked, build artifacts included the
  MCP Proxy README, and license/security metadata was verified.

## [0.7.13] - 2026-05-08

Fresh release for the MCP action-control toolbox expansion.

### Added
- Added 8 local/full `agentveil-mcp` action-control tools:
  `runtime_evaluate_action`, `controlled_action`, `get_approval_request`,
  `approve_action`, `deny_action`, `execute_after_approval`,
  `get_decision_receipt`, and `get_execution_receipt`.

### Changed
- Updated MCP docs and instructions to position the server as an explicit
  action-control toolbox for Runtime Gate, approval, and signed receipt
  workflows. Local/full mode now exposes 20 tools; hosted read-only mode
  remains at 8 tools.
- Refreshed Glama metadata, roadmap, PyPI README, skill instructions, and MCP
  integration examples so public-facing descriptions match the 20-tool
  local/full MCP surface.

### Validation
- MCP-1 production live smoke passed against `https://agentveil.dev`, covering
  full/readonly tool registration, Runtime Gate evaluation, controlled action
  allow/wait/block outcomes, approval get/approve/deny, approved execution,
  and DecisionReceipt / ExecutionReceipt fetches with sha256 verification.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_mcp_hosted.py tests/test_mcp_packaging.py -q`
  passed with `36 passed`.
- `python -m pytest -q` passed with `262 passed, 1 warning`.

## [0.7.12] - 2026-05-08

Self-service developer adoption: Proof Packet export helper, corrected
approval payload references, Live Developer Adoption Smoke evidence path, and
Mode A onboarding docs.

### Added
- Added `AVPAgent.get_decision_receipt(audit_id: str) -> str` so customers can
  fetch exact signed Runtime Gate DecisionReceipt JSON text and pass it into
  `build_proof_packet(...)` without parsing and re-serializing the signed
  bytes. See `docs/PROOF_PACKET.md` and `docs/API.md`.
- Added the production release-gate smoke
  `examples/live_developer_adoption_smoke.py` with
  `docs/LIVE_DEVELOPER_ADOPTION_SMOKE.md`. It validates the self-service path
  against `https://agentveil.dev`: DelegationReceipt issue/verify, all three
  Runtime Gate outcomes, approval resume, Proof Packet export, strict offline
  verification, and typed SDK errors.
- Added Mode A and advanced network onboarding docs:
  `docs/MODE_A_QUICKSTART.md` for the Project Owner path and
  `docs/ADVANCED_AGENT_NETWORK.md` for reputation, attestations, DID identity,
  and W3C VC primitives.

### Fixed
- Corrected approval-required snippets, docs, examples, and mocks to use
  `outcome.approval["approval_id"]`, matching the production payload. Previous
  docs used either `outcome.approval_id` (not populated on the initial
  `approval_required` outcome) or `outcome.approval["id"]` from mock-only
  examples. See `docs/APPROVAL_ROUTING.md`,
  `docs/CUSTOMER_INTEGRATION.md`, and `examples/approval_flow.py`.
- Corrected the README `attest_batch(...)` example so the negative attestation
  includes both `context` and a 64-character lowercase hex `evidence_hash`.
  The `# 3, 0` success/failure comment now matches the server contract.

### Changed
- Linked the new release smoke from the README documentation table and
  cross-linked the Proof Packet, approval, registration, delegation, and error
  guides so the self-service flow has a complete evidence path.
- Repositioned the public docs around the primary action-control path while
  keeping advanced agent-network primitives discoverable for customers who need
  reputation, attestations, or credential workflows.

### Validation
- Live Developer Adoption Smoke passed against production `agentveil.dev` with
  strict trusted signer DID verification.
- `python -m pytest -q` passed with `256 passed, 1 warning`.

## [0.7.11] — 2026-05-08

### Changed
- Reframed PyPI metadata around action-control positioning:
  - `pyproject.toml` description now leads with posture checks, action gates,
    signed receipts, and proof packets instead of identity-first phrasing.
  - `README_PYPI.md` Quick Start now uses `issue_delegation_receipt(...)` and
    `verify_delegation_receipt(...)`, matching the main README action-control
    lead.

No functional SDK changes. `agentveil.__version__` was updated to match the
wheel metadata. Same API surface as 0.7.10.

### Validation
- `python3 -m build` passed.
- `python3 -m twine check` passed for the built wheel and sdist.
- `python3 -m pytest -q` passed with `236 passed, 19 skipped, 1 warning`.
- PyPI Quick Start snippet verified in a clean venv: `delegation valid: True`,
  `scope: deploy`.

## [0.7.10] — 2026-05-07

### Changed
- Added a PyPI-specific project description with absolute links and no embedded
  GitHub-relative images, so the PyPI project page renders cleanly.
- Polished the GitHub README hero with the AgentVeil logo, centered product
  heading, compact badges, and simplified quick links.

### Validation
- `python3 -m build --outdir /tmp/avp-0710-build` passed.
- `python3 -m twine check` passed for the built wheel and sdist.
- `python3 -m pytest -q` passed with `236 passed, 19 skipped`.

## [0.7.7] — 2026-05-06

### Changed
- Aligned public API docs, security notes, roadmap, skill instructions, and
  examples around AgentVeil action control: Runtime Gate, signed receipts,
  advisory reputation APIs, and MCP profile/audit surfaces.
- Updated MCP server instructions and Docker entrypoints to use the
  `agentveil-mcp` console command and clarify the SDK Runtime Gate path for
  risky action execution.
- Updated the quickstart and wheel verification examples to run against the
  current package metadata without requiring a live backend.
- Replaced the default DelegationReceipt purpose text with neutral
  controlled-action wording.
- Made the PyPI publish workflow idempotent when artifacts already exist.

### Validation
- `PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/test_delegation_issuance.py tests/test_controlled_action.py -q`
  passed.
- `PYTHONPATH=. python3 examples/quickstart.py` passed.

## [0.7.6] — 2026-05-06

### Changed
- Reframed the public README around AgentVeil action control: local smoke test,
  production integration shape, Runtime Gate, approvals, signed receipts, and
  controlled-action proof packets.
- Moved advisory reputation APIs into a dedicated reference section while
  keeping existing `can_trust(...)`, `@avp_tracked(...)`, and framework tool
  documentation discoverable.
- Updated Features, Security, Proof Pack, and Integrations copy to reduce
  overclaims and match the current SDK/API surface.
- Added Gemini and PydanticAI examples to the integrations table.
- Updated PyPI metadata keywords for action-control, runtime-gate,
  controlled-actions, and signed-receipts positioning.
- Clarified the Microsoft Agent Governance Toolkit / AgentMesh integration and
  softened the Glama directory label while retaining the verified listing.

### Validation
- README local/mock snippets pass from a clean editable install.
- Markdown/link sanity checks passed for README tables, fences, and local docs
  links.
- `agentmesh-avp==0.1.1` verified to export `AVPProvider`; README avoids an
  unverified `TrustEngine(...)` constructor claim.

## [0.7.5] — 2026-05-05

### Changed
- `AVPAgent.get_onboarding_challenge()` now signs the owner-only onboarding
  challenge GET request automatically with AVP-Sig. This keeps SDK onboarding
  helpers compatible with the backend onboarding privacy tightening where
  challenge details are no longer public.
- `auto_answer_onboarding_challenge()` inherits the signed challenge fetch
  because it delegates to `get_onboarding_challenge()`.

### Required action
- Upgrade before using this SDK with backend deployments where
  `GET /v1/onboarding/{did}/challenge` is owner-only. Older SDK versions may
  receive `401` from `get_onboarding_challenge()` after that backend change.

## [0.7.4] — 2026-04-30

### Added
- `verify_signed_jcs(...)` for offline DataIntegrityProof /
  `eddsa-jcs-2022` signature verification of signed JCS proof artifacts.
- `verify_proof_packet(...)` for AVP-level semantic verification of
  DelegationReceipt, DecisionReceipt, HumanApprovalReceipt, and
  ExecutionReceipt proof chains.
- Role-specific trusted signer DID configuration for DecisionReceipt,
  ExecutionReceipt, and HumanApprovalReceipt verification.
- Optional `decision_receipt_jcs` support in `ProofPacket` and
  `AVPAgent.build_proof_packet(...)`.

### Changed
- Customer integration docs now include an offline proof verification recipe,
  receipt schema/version matrix, and trust-anchor guidance.

## [0.7.3] — 2026-04-30

### Added
- `ProofPacket` typed result object and `AVPAgent.build_proof_packet(...)` for
  bundling explicit controlled-action proof artifacts while preserving raw
  signed receipt strings.
- `AVPAgent.issue_delegation_receipt(...)` and
  `AVPAgent.verify_delegation_receipt(...)` ergonomic wrappers around the
  existing DelegationReceipt v1 issue/verify primitives.
- `docs/PILOT_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md` for guided first customer integrations.

### Changed
- `AVPAgent.integration_preflight()` now distinguishes `agent_revoked`,
  `agent_migrated`, and `nonce_replay` setup/auth states.
- Customer integration docs now clarify that DelegationReceipt v1 covers
  current backend-enforced category and financial predicates, while requested
  action, resource, and environment are supplied to Runtime Gate and
  cross-checked there.
- `pyproject.toml` now uses SPDX license metadata syntax: `license = "MIT"`.

## [0.7.2] — 2026-04-29

### Added
- `AVPAgent.integration_preflight()` for safe customer integration checks before
  the first controlled action. The helper verifies local identity loading,
  API reachability, public agent registration/verification state, and a signed
  read path without mutating backend state.
- Typed `IntegrationPreflightReport` with customer-clear statuses such as
  `ready`, `unregistered`, `signature_invalid`, `unverified_or_forbidden`,
  `agent_suspended`, `rate_limited`, and `backend_or_config_unavailable`.
- `examples/first_controlled_action.py` template for the first preflight-gated
  controlled action with explicit DelegationReceipt handoff.

### Changed
- Signed SDK requests with non-empty query parameters now emit AVP-Sig v2,
  binding a canonicalized query string into the Ed25519 signature.
- Signed requests without query parameters remain AVP-Sig v1 during the
  backend compatibility window.

### Validation
- Production backend v2 acceptance was deployed before this SDK release
  candidate.
- Production smoke against `https://agentveil.dev` passed with
  `integration_preflight()` ready and signed v2 remediation case discovery.

### Known limitations
- AVP-Sig v1 query-bearing requests remain accepted by the backend during the
  migration window and are warning-logged until a future sunset.

## [0.7.1] — 2026-04-29

### Changed
- Reworded public controlled-action documentation and release notes to use
  clear customer-facing integration language.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-04-29

### Added — Controlled-action integration
- Runtime Control wrappers for `runtime_evaluate()`,
  `get_runtime_decision()`, `execute()`, and `get_execution_receipt()`.
- Human Approval wrappers for `create_approval()`, `get_approval()`,
  `approve()`, and `deny()`.
- Governance and Remediation wrappers for policy/risk-event/case flows.
- High-level `controlled_action()` orchestration and
  `execute_after_approval()` resume path.
- Typed `ControlledActionOutcome` result object with attribute access,
  light dict-style compatibility, and `to_dict()`.
- `docs/CUSTOMER_INTEGRATION.md` covering secrets, first controlled action,
  approval resume, error map, and compliance packet.

### Changed
- HTTP response handling now accepts both `200` and `201` success
  responses.
- Signed execution and approval receipt endpoints preserve exact raw JSON
  text for offline proof instead of parsing and re-serializing.
- `429` handling now parses `Retry-After` defensively.

### Validation
- Production API smoke passed against `https://agentveil.dev` on
  2026-04-29 using a signed read path and safe `runtime_evaluate()`
  for `infra.resource.inspect`.

### Known limitations
- AVP-Sig v1 still signs the path without query-string binding to match
  the deployed backend protocol. This is tracked for a future coordinated
  AVP-Sig v2 backend + SDK rollout.
- `controlled_action()` does not auto-approve human-control decisions.
  Callers must resume with `execute_after_approval()` after principal
  approval.

## [0.6.2] — 2026-04-27

### Added — DelegationReceipt primitive
- New `agentveil.delegation` module shipping a minimal AVP runtime-
  control primitive: a W3C Verifiable Credential v2.0 receipt that
  records who authorized which agent to act, within what scope, and
  for how long.
- `issue_delegation()` signs a receipt with the principal's Ed25519
  `did:key`. Scope predicates supported in v1: `max_spend`
  (ISO 4217 currency + amount) and `allowed_category` (string value).
  Validity is bounded by `validFrom` / `validUntil`. Receipts are
  canonicalized with RFC 8785 JCS before signing.
- `verify_delegation()` performs offline verification: structure
  checks, expiration window, scope-predicate validation,
  `eddsa-jcs-2022` Data Integrity Proof. No network calls, no
  AVP backend dependency.
- Standalone reference verifier (~180 lines, only `pynacl` /
  `base58` / `jcs` dependencies, no `agentveil` SDK import) at
  `examples/delegation/verify.py` — auditors can read and run it
  without trusting the SDK.
- JSON-LD context pinned at `https://agentveil.dev/contexts/delegation/v1.jsonld`.

### Schema stability
- `DelegationReceipt` v1 wire format is intended to be stable. Future
  extensions add new optional predicates rather than alter existing
  ones — anything else would invalidate already-signed receipts.

### Not changed
- All existing reputation, attestation, registration, MCP, and
  webhook-alert surfaces are untouched.

## [0.6.1] — 2026-04-23

### Added (B3 — negative attestation DX)
- `AVPAgent.attest()` now raises `AVPValidationError` client-side when
  `outcome="negative"` is passed without both `context` and a valid SHA-256
  `evidence_hash` (64 lowercase hex chars). Mirrors the server-side
  requirement in `app/api/v1/attestations.py` so callers fail fast with a
  clear message instead of chasing a 400 from the server.
- Same validation added to `AVPMockAgent.attest()` so mock-mode code paths
  surface the issue before hitting a real backend.
- Docstring updated to mark `context` and `evidence_hash` as REQUIRED for
  negative outcomes.

### Added (B9 partial — explainability for starter floor)
- `ReputationResponse` and `TrustCheckResponse` now expose explicit
  `raw_score`, `display_score`, `floor_applied: bool`, `floor_reason` fields.
- `TrustCheckResponse.reason` includes a human-readable `[starter floor
  applied …]` suffix when applicable.
- `docs/PROTOCOL.md` now has a "Starter Floor Semantics" section.

### Known limitation
- `raw_score` is `null` whenever the starter floor is applied. The backend
  currently stores only the gated score, so the pre-floor signal is not
  recoverable after the fact. `floor_applied = true` is the truthful signal;
  `raw_score` exposure requires a DB migration tracked separately.

### Not changed
- Reputation computation, decision logic, `allowed` / `tier` / `risk_level`
  semantics, and the single source-of-truth (`get_latest_score`).

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-23

### Changed (behavior change — not backward compatible)
- `register()` no longer blocks on onboarding completion. Onboarding runs
  server-side in the background after `/verify`; the call returns as soon as
  the agent is verified. Prior versions implicitly waited up to ~30s for an
  LLM-driven onboarding challenge and auto-answered it.
- `register()` return dict now includes `onboarding_pending: bool` so callers
  can branch without polling.

### Added
- `auto_answer_onboarding_challenge(max_wait=30.0)` — explicit, opt-in helper
  that reproduces the pre-v0.6.0 behavior (poll challenge, auto-submit a stock
  answer). Returns the challenge result dict or `None`.
- `wait_for_onboarding(timeout=60.0, poll_interval=2.0)` — explicit helper that
  blocks until onboarding reaches a terminal state (`completed` / `failed` /
  `not_started`). Raises `TimeoutError` on timeout.
- Structured `challenge_expired` handling: backend now returns `409` with
  `fresh_challenge` / `fresh_pow_challenge` / `fresh_pow_difficulty` in the
  error body so clients can retry `/verify` without a new `/register` call.

### Deprecated
- `_auto_handle_onboarding_challenge()` — retained as an internal alias for
  one release. New code must use `auto_answer_onboarding_challenge()`.

### Migration
- If you relied on the implicit onboarding wait inside `register()`, add an
  explicit call to `agent.auto_answer_onboarding_challenge()` and/or
  `agent.wait_for_onboarding()` after `register()`.
- If you only care about registration being verified, no code change is
  needed — `register()` now just returns faster.

### Onboarding state semantics (explicit)
`GET /v1/onboarding/{did}` — exact states returned:
- Unknown DID → HTTP 404 "Agent not found".
- Agent exists but `/verify` has not run yet (post-register, pre-verify) →
  200 with `status="not_started"`. Synthetic response (no session row yet).
- Agent verified, no card published, session waiting → 200 with
  `status="pending"` (session row created at verify; pipeline idle).
- Agent verified, card present, background pipeline running → 200 with
  `status="in_progress"` + `current_stage`.
- Terminal states → `status="completed"` or `status="failed"`.

The `not_started` window is narrow (between `/register` and `/verify`) but
real. Clients must treat `status` — not HTTP code — as the source of truth
for onboarding lifecycle.

### Performance note
Latency numbers observed in local validation (register ~0.2s, 5 agents
sequential ~1.4s total) were measured with `POW_DIFFICULTY_BITS=18` — the
documented **development override**. Production default remains **28 bits**;
real client-side PoW solve adds 10-150s on single-threaded CPUs depending
on hardware. What v0.6.0 fixes is the **hidden onboarding-wait block**, not
PoW latency. The two are independent; PoW ergonomics are tracked separately.

## [0.5.8] — 2026-04-22

### Changed
- README: replaced Glama MCP Directory image badge with a plain text link.
  The badge rendered the current Glama quality score ("not tested") which
  looked weak on the PyPI package page. The directory listing is still
  linked, just without the score card image.

### Notes
- No runtime, API, or behavior changes. Pure README/package-metadata update.

## [0.5.7] — 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- `_auto_handle_challenge` no longer blocks the event loop when called from an
  async context. Polling work is now offloaded to a daemon thread
  (`avp-challenge-{name}`); sync callers behave exactly as before.

> Note: versions 0.5.3–0.5.6 were published to PyPI without changelog entries.
> See git history for what changed in those releases.
